# Custom Snippet for the answer Function in Quiz App

The `answer` function in your Flask application validates the player's answer and directs the game flow. Below is the custom snippet to add this functionality to your `routes.py` file:

```json
  "Function to Handle Answer Submission": {
    "prefix": "handleAnswerSubmission",
    "body": [
      "@app.route('/answer', methods=['POST'])",
      "def answer():",
      "    if 'correct_choice' not in session or 'choice' not in request.form:",
      "        # If the correct_choice is not in session or no choice was made, redirect to game",
      "        return redirect(url_for('game'))",
      "",
      "    # Get the choice from the form or default to 0 if not found",
      "    selected_choice = int(request.form.get('choice', 0))",
      "    ",
      "    correct_choice = session['correct_choice']",
      "    ",
      "    if selected_choice == correct_choice:",
      "        session['score'] += 1",
      "    ",
      "    # Increment question number and append the id of the question that was just answered",
      "    session['question_number'] = session.get('question_number', 1) + 1",
      "    session['question_ids_asked'].append(correct_choice)",
      "    ",
      "    if session['question_number'] > 10:",
      "        return redirect(url_for('results'))",
      "    else:",
      "        return redirect(url_for('game'))"
    ],
    "description": "This function handles the player's answer submission, updates the score if correct, and redirects to the next question or results page."
}
